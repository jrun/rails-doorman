rails_doorman
============

Ruby on Rails plugin that provides an allow/deny DSL for controlling access

deny :host => "209.34.*"
deny :user => "bill"       # calls current_user.login, but this is configurable
deny :user_agent => /MSIE/

# mostly closed:
deny :all                           # removes implicit final allow :all
allow :host => "*.example.com"
